  <body><h3>Alicia Keys - If I Ain't Got You </h3>
   
    <div>Some people live for the fortune <br>
    Some people live just for the fame<br>
    Some people live for the power, yeah<br>
    Some people live just to play the game<br>
    Some people think that the physical things<br>
    Define what's within<br>
    And I've been there before but that life's a bore<br>
    So full of the superficial<br>
    And some people want it all<br>
    But I don't want nothing at all<br>
    If it ain't you, baby<br>
    If I ain't got you, baby<br>
  </div>
