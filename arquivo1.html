  <body> <h3> Olivia Rodrigo - Drivers license </h3>
    
    <div> I got my driver's license last week<br>
    Just like we always talked about<br>
    'Cause you were so excited for me<br>
    To finally drive up to your house</div><br>
  <section>  But today I drove through the suburbs<br>
    Crying 'cause you weren't around<br>
    And you're probably with that blonde girl<br>
    Who always made me doubt<br>
    She's so much older than me<br>
    She's everything I'm insecure about<br>
    Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs<br>
    'Cause how could I ever love someone else?</section> <br>
